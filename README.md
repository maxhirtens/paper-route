## What is Paper Route?

Paper Route is a site that uses AI language models to summarize today's top news from the New York Times (and eventually other newspaper sources.) You can choose to receive a summary of the following news sections: arts, business, politics, technology, sports, world, or simply the current front page.
Several different personas are available to use. For example, you can select "summarize today's politics news as Shakespeare", or "summarize the front page for a second-grader".

An example summary for "the business section with lots of emojis":
